# Lighthouse

+++

This problem is taken from "Data Analysis, a Bayesian Tutorial" by D.S. Silva with J. Skiling. A lighthouse distance $h=1$ from the shore is rotating with constant angular frequency and emitting thin beams of light at random. The probability of emission is uniform in time. The signals are picked up on the shore by an array of detectors and their location is saved in the file `lighthouse.txt`.  The horizontal location of the lighthouse $x_{lh}$ is unknown. The task is to estimate this position.

```{code-cell} ipython3
flash_x = np.loadtxt('lighthouse.txt')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
h=1
```

The figure below  presents the geometry of the problem. The orange dot indicates the lighthouse. Blue dots are the points were the flashes were recorded. The directions of the first 10 flashes are shown as lightblue lines.

```{code-cell} ipython3
x0=10;
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig,ax=plt.subplots();
ax.set_ylim(0,1.1)
ax.set_xlim(-350,200)
aspect = lh.get_aspect(ax)

ax.scatter(flash_x,np.zeros_like(flash_x), zorder=10, c='blue');
ax.axvline(x0, color='black')

for i in range(10):
    ax.plot([flash_x[i],x0],[0,1], c='lightblue', zorder=-10)    
ax.scatter([x0],[1],s=200, zorder=10, c='orange');
thetas=np.arctan((flash_x[:10]-x0)*aspect)
arc3=Arc((x0,h),0.75/aspect,0.75, 0, np.rad2deg(-np.pi), 0,edgecolor='black', linewidth=0.5);ax.add_patch(arc3);
ax.scatter(*lh.polar2xy((x0,h),-np.pi/2+thetas,0.75/(2*aspect), aspect=aspect));
xy = lh.polar2xy((x0,h),-np.pi/2+np.pi/30,0.85/(2*aspect), aspect=aspect)
ax.annotate("$\phi$",xy, fontsize=24);
```

$$x = h*\tan(\phi)+x_0\qquad \phi=\frac{1}{h}\arctan(x-x_0)$$
